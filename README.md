# Predict Natural Disasters
## Tech. used --> Weather API, Twitter API, Google Maps API, machine learning, deep learning and much more.
## 1. Earthquakes
* For predicting the Earthquakes we first of all collect the data of sound waves that that are emitted during or just before the time of earthquakes from histroy.
* then we fit normal sound and sounds that are emitted during earthqakes into dataset.
* Then we convert data into training set and test set and train these data on neural network-based approach.
* After training these data over a large period of time now we can predict by taking sound wave as input and we can predict that these sound are came from earth is part of earthquakes or not.
* And Similarly we can also train in seismic signal that came during earthquakes and predict the chance of Earthquakes.
